# Digi-Oramics
Digi Oramics synthesiser based off Oram's Oramics Machine
This repo contains:
	- the pd patch containing the Digi-Oramics Synthesiser
	- A number of example Compositions made by me to demonstrate the synth
	- Audio recordings of said compositions

In order to open the Digi-Oramics PD Patch you will need to have Purr Data installed, which can be obtained here:
https://github.com/jonwwilkes/purr-data/releases

Some brief Instructions:
In order to hear sound you must turn the DSP switch on, this can be found in the header under Media->Audio On. Then the synth will produce sound
as soon as you hit the On/Off Switch. By drawing lines onto the graphs at the bottom of the PD Patch you can alter the nature of the sound.

Have fun experimenting with the program and seeing what you can come up with!
